# Compute-the-days-of-occurrences-of-your-birthday-
In this small project, the goal is to use the built-in JS class `Date();` and create a table that has for task counting the number of days of a week, in which my birthday occurs from a start-year to an end-year. 
There is not much else to say about this project for now. Bye bye.
